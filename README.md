# Tattl

Eliminate online distractions by logging your visits to potentially distracting websites.

Tattl is a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that pairs with a Discord bot to allow you to log your visits to distracting websites such as YouTube in a Discord channel in order to keep you focused.

I made this bot because simply blocking YouTube on my computer was too restrictive. Although it stopped me from getting carried away watching pointless YouTube videos, it also stopped me from following useful tutorial videos.

Each time you visit a website that you chose to watch, Tattl will log the url and your name in a Discord channel. The idea is that the added pressure that comes from knowing that your friends can see this browsing activity will discourage you from using those websites in a bad way, while still allowing you to freely use them in a good way.

For example, if I choose to track my visits to YouTube I will be discouraged from watching entertainment videos, because that would be embarrassing, but I will be free to watch tutorial videos, because I know my friends will see that as an acceptable use of YouTube.

Get together with some friends and try it yourself.
